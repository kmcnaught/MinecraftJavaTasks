We will inspect and modify the behaviour of a projectile when it hits an entity. 

We will practise:
- using the debugger to follow what's happening
- changing control flow to tweak behaviour
- using eclipse "suggest" to explore the methods we can call on an entity

# Intro 
We are using the `MBE81a Throwable Emoji` item which is found in the Miscellaneous tab. This has been modified from the original MBE code so make sure you have the new files.
Debug the project in Eclipse. Get yourself into a creative world and find some Pigs, Sheep and other entities (you may need to spawn some yourself). Select the emoji item and "use item" (right click) to throw. See what happens when it hits an animal. 

# Tasks
1 - Put a breakpoint in line 75 of EmojiEntity.java. This will pause the code when you manage to hit an entity with your emoji
